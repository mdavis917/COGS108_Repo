In contrast, having a manufacturing business in Houston, Dallas, or Denver will more likely to succeed. Intuitively, it makes sense that cities with high living costs (like California cities) have more risks for startup companies because the comapnies would have a difficult time covering all its expenses before they make a profit. Similarly, technology businesses need to constantly obtain the most recent technical information to stay competitive, and thus makes the industry more demanding than others.\n",

Despite recieving the most funding these fields have the worst performance in longevity and closed ratio as well as average funding. Due to oversaturation VC's aren't as willing to risk funds on these companies and they will likely fail.

    " - Philadelphia\n",
    "     - Based on results Philly has manufacturing and food and beverage companies that have been around for an average of almost 50 years. These seem to have skewed the data to appear as one of the the best cities for longevity however there is not a whole lot of data present to draw any good conclusions. Likely there are alot of existing companies in Philly but not much growth which is why data isnt present for most fields other than longevity.\n",

    " - Media and Entertainment\n",
    "     - Silicon Valley is once again one of the most popular. However in this case they also do have decent average funding. However, the close rate is higher and longevity lower in Silicon Valley. The story with Silicon Valley is also roughly similar to New York and Los Angeles. Overall it seems like it is harder to recive funds out of these areas and in these areas success is hard to find so overall it seems like a difficult industry. \n",

Atlanta while not having nearly as much funding does seem to have success in the market for close rate and longevity, and they have decent median funding. Atlanta is likely an emerging area for mobile development.\n",

In addition Phoenix has a great close rate and longevity. Likely a much better option for a startup than Silicon Valley\n",
    " - Energy\n",
    "     - Not too suprising given the exploration into Dallas and Houston but Texas seems to be the place to be for the energy sector. The amount of funding dwarfs any other state. And longevity and close rate are all great for texas cities as well\n",

In addition Austin preforms well for mean funding but is only in the middle in other fields. So there is likely a very good performer there but not on average.  \n",
    " - Manufacturing\n",
    "     - Silicon Valley finally performs very well at something. Other than longevity silicon valley is great for manufacturing and there is tons of funding to go around. It has a worse closed ratio however, the closed ratio overall of manufacturing is much lower than any other field. This success makes sense. Since there are so many other startups that are constantly changing in silicon valley. They likely need there products built. This is where the manufacturers are able to get plenty of buisness.\n",

All other cities that are top in one category are much lower in others and it becomes hard to distinguish between them. The Silicon Valley and New york problem is present where there is alot of money but also lots of competition for it.\n",

Silicon Valley has a better median funding than most of other industries there but still has a high close rate."
